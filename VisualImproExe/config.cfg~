# Y,YES,O or OUI to enable effects.
# It is advised to disable them, as they cause a loss of performance and there is only one effect avaible (a simple echo)

# Number of analog inputs (from 0 to 8). Analog inputs are actually overriden by the 8 audio inputs at the top of the bela.
# The program automatically adapts the sample rate to the number of channels. If analog <= 4, the sample rate will be 44100 hz, else it will be 22050
# If you choose x channels, then you must plug your devices on channels 0 to x-1 .
